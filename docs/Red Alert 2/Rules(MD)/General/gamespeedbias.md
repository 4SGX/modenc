# [GameSpeedBias]

```ini
GameSpeedBias=1.00 ; Floating point values
```

This flag acts as a global multiplier to the speed of all units in the game. It does not affect the speed of projectiles or animations.
 ### Important Note: 
 Curiously, this also acts as a direct multiplier to BuildSpeed, thus increasing/decreasing the rate at which all buildings and units are built.
