ObjectTypes is the class from which all objects that can be seen on the map, such as Animations, Particles, Overlays, are derived. No object of this class is ever directly created. The main four object types - Infantry, Vehicles, Aircraft and Buildings - are derived from TechnoTypes which derives from this one.
